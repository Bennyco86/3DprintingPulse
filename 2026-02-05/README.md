🦺 Nivalon Leverages AI and 3D Printing to Create Personalized, Motion-Preserving Spinal Implants
company creating patient-specific spinal implants Nivalon Medical Technologies has developed what it describes as the first fully patient-specific spinal implant that preserves natural motion without metal components.
The device combines AI-driven design with advanced ceramic 3D printing, using a zirconia-toughened alumina (ZTA) structure and a flexible core to replicate spinal movement, reported by 3D Printing Industry on Feb 03, 2026.

🏠 Metal 3D printing on Mars: shielding gas from the atmosphere instead of argon
For longer missions on Mars, metal 3D printing will become important as a tool for repair and infrastructure.
A preprint study (arXiv) tested three shielding-gas environments when selectively laser melting 316L stainless steel: argon, CO₂, and air, reported by 3Printr on Feb 04, 2026.

🖨 YouTuber measures breaking forces: Toolpath tuning noticeably changes FDM strength
By default, many slicers first print the outer walls of FDM parts and then add the infill to the component.
Maker NeedItMakeIt investigated a potential weak point in this sequence and tested an alternative line layout, reported by 3Printr on Feb 04, 2026.

📷 OTEC optimizes automated finishing for 3D-printed earmolds and titanium ear pieces
Custom earmolds (otoplastics) are now often produced via additive manufacturing because geometries from an ear scan can be manufactured directly as one-off parts.
However, a downside of common 3D-printing processes remains the typical surface roughness of the raw parts, reported by 3Printr on Feb 04, 2026.
