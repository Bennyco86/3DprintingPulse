🦺 CRAFT controls crystallinity during 3D printing and varies hardness and transparency pixel by pixel
Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and Sandia National Laboratories present CRAFT, a 3D-printing process that controls material properties at pixel-level resolution via grayscale light.
Using just a single cyclooctene-based resin, a DLP/LCD printer can create hard, opaque regions and soft, transparent regions—such as for realistic hand models for surgical training or shock-absorbing […] The post, reported by 3Printr on Feb 02, 2026.
